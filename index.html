<p> this is the offical website that orginizes the soccer <a href="http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/">tournements</a></p>
<p> i recognize serveral elements from the one week of html that i have done, either from my own research or from the class. There is a lot that i don't know. Most of which is formating stuff and CSS with parent and child classes. Overall this site is good because it is well organized and clearly presented. </p>
